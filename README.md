# DQN
The goal for this project is to gain a deeper understanding of DQN by implementing it in Python and comparing it to a baseline implementation. The reference for this work is the 2015 paper [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf) by Mnih et al. 

## Software Packages
To make this project somewhat easier on myself, I will be using the following software packages in this work:
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)
* [stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html)
* [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)

## First Questions
How close to the original experimental results can we achieve using a baseline?
